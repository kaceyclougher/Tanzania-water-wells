# Predicting Functionality of Tanzanian Water Wells
### Author: Kacey Clougher

Within this repository, you will find a comprehensive analysis that classifies Tanzanian water wells into three categories: functional, non-functional, or in need of repair. The aim of this detailed analysis is to ensure accessibility and replicability.

## Project Understanding

This project aims to employ machine learning classification models for predicting the operational status of water wells in Tanzania. The classification encompasses three groups: functional, non-functional, and functional but in need of repair. The ultimate goal is to leverage this modeling approach to forecast the functionality of a newly constructed well or the rejuvenation of an existing non-functional well.

## Data
Using machine learning classification models to predict the operational status of water wells in Tanzania, we classify each well into three categories: functional, non-functional, and functional but needs repair. You can find the original data set of over 60,000 wells here: [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table] (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/)
